# Configuration

.Available configuration variables
|===
| Var | Meaning (__Default value__)
| 1  | Address of first turnout. (__6__)
| 7  | Duration of pulse, in ms. Max: 255. (__10__) 
| 8  | Pulse count for each open/close action. Recommended<5, max 255 [1]. (default: __1__)
|===
[1] The decoder does not process new messages while it is doing pulses, so too many pulses for one turnout may delay or disrupt operation of next turnout.

The decoder can be configured in 2 ways:

## Using throttle

. Connect a throttle and decoder to command station. 
Command station is not needed for communication, but something needs to power the LocoNet bus, decoder and throttle.

. Hold button (marked BT1) on the decoder for 3s (when you press the button, the blinking LED (marked LED1) on the board will turn off. After 3 seconds, it will start blinking fast with 0.4s interval to make it easier to decide when to release the button).

. While the LED is blinking fast, the decoder is expecting variable number to be input with a throttle. To change variable with number N, simply throw a turnout with address N. After that, the LED will start blinking even faster (0.15s interval).

. While the LED is blinking faster, the decoder is expecting variable value to be input with a throttle. Again, to set var value to M, just throw a turnout with address M. The decoder will store the new value in EEPROM and LED will start blinking normally. 

**TL;DR:**
To set variable 1 to 20: go to config mode via long button press, throw turnout 1, throw turnout 20. Watch the LED for hints.

To change another value, start procedure from pt. 1.

If new settings are not working, reset the board with a reset button on the Arduino and file an issue.

## Using SVs

TODO.

The decoder accepts LocoNet System Variable (SVs) messages.
You can read and write SVs with JMRI, but decoder XML definition for JMRI is not created yet.
