This repository contains code for several DIY accessory decoders for LocoNet bus. 

* link:LND-8CDU[LND-8CDU] - A decoder with 8 capacitor-discharge outputs.
* link:LND-L-PCA9685[LND-L-PCA9685] - LED decoder with 16 LEDs (with PCA9685 or 24 LEDs with TLC5947) for signaling.
* LND-16L8I - A decoder with 16 LED (constant-current) outputs and 8 digital inputs (and 2 analog). 
Deprecated for now, PCA9685 above is better (i.e. it allows changing brightness of individual LEDs).

The projects are for Arduino Pro Mini and PlatformIO, but will work with any decent Arduino and can be built with Arduino IDE.
