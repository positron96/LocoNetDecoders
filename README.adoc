This repository contains code for several DIY accessory decoders for LocoNet bus. 

* link:LND-8CDU[LND-8CDU] - A decoder with 8 capacitor-discharge outputs.
* link:LND-L-PCA9685[LND-L-PCA9685] - LED decoder with 16 LEDs for signaling.
* LND-16L8I - A decoder with 16 LED (constant-current) outputs and 8 digital inputs (and 2 analog). Depreacted for now, PCA9685 is better.

The projects are for Arduino Pro Mini and PlatformIO, but will work with any decent Arduino and can be built with Arduino IDE.
