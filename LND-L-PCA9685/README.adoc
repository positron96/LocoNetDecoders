## LND-L-PCA9685 - A 16 LED LocoNet decoder

This is a firmware for LocoNet-only accessory decoder for 16 LEDs.

PCA9685 board (or bare IC) is used to controll LEDs. 
Theoretically, 62 PCA9685 boards can be connected to one I2C master, giving 992 possible LEDs. 
At the moment the firmware supports only 1 board and 16 LEDs.

Features:

* Smooth lightup/fade
* Separate brightness for each LED output
* OpSwitch-like configuration 
* Configuration via UART

Extra functionality:

* 8 digital inputs value (reported to LocoNet)
* 2 analog inputs
