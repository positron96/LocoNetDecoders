## LND-L-PCA9685 - A 16 LED LocoNet decoder


image:https://img.youtube.com/vi/hhKzCz2ck-I/mqdefault.jpg[link=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhKzCz2ck-I]


This is a firmware for LocoNet-only accessory decoder for 16 LEDs.

PCA9685 module (or bare IC) is used to controll LEDs. 
Theoretically, 62 PCA9685 boards can be connected to one I2C master, giving 992 possible LEDs. 
At the moment the firmware supports only 1 board and 16 LEDs.

Features:

* Smooth lightup/fade
* Separate brightness for each LED output
* OpSwitch-like configuration 
* Configuration via UART

Extra functionality:

* 8 digital inputs value that are reported to LocoNet (Can be used as sensor board)
* 2 analog inputs

The firmware is written using PlatformIO build system and Arduino framework.
VS Code is recommended as an IDE. 
The code can also be built with Arduino IDE with minimal changes (some files need to be moved around and some libraries need to be installed).

The project requires the following libraries:

. https://github.com/mrrwa/LocoNet[LocoNet]
. https://www.etlcpp.com/[Embedded Template Library]

PlatformIO will install the required versions automatically.

## Hardware

The firmware is designed to work with this decoder board:

* https://oshwlab.com/positron96/loconet-decoder-2_copy_copy_copy[Decoder mainboard at OSHWLAB]

* https://oshwlab.com/positron96/test-pcb-pattern_copy[LocoNet breakout board at OSHWLAB]

The board features:

* Arduino Pro Mini socket (5V 32kB variant required)
* PCA9685 board socket
* 2 LocoNet jacks
* Can be powered through LocoNet bus or from external power connector
* Button to enter configuration
* Indicator LED

The code is compatible with PCBs v1 and v2 (pins are different), the board in use can be selected by 
uncommented corresponding ifdefs in `.ino` file.

## User manual

### Aspect values

Aspects are modeled after http://www.modelldepo.ru/dcc/index.php?current_folder=46[ModellDepo TrafficLight  decoder (RU)], which supports USSR and Russian signaling system. 

Current version supports 1-, 2- and 3-lamp signals.
